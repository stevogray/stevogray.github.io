The NavLight system has two main components: the Punches and the Tags. The Punches are powered by one AA battery and hang from a cord at each checkpoint. The Tags are unpowered and are worn on the wrist by competitors, one or two per team, as the event organiser chooses.

When a competitor visits a checkpoint they record their visit by inserting the Punch into the Tag; a process which typically takes half a second. Both the Punch and the Tag record the visit and the time.

One or more Punches would normally be placed at the Finish line, to record the actual finish time of each competitor. The Tag is then surrendered and is read by the third component of the system; an Interface unit connected via an RS232 Serial Port (or USB-Serial Port adapter) to a PC.&nbsp; The Interface unit looks rather like a Punch with the centre part of a Tag piggybacked on the side.

Reading a Tag allows a final score, including late penalties, to be immediately calculated, and a printout shows competitors a list of checkpoints visited, value, time of punching, total score, penalties, and final score. When all Tags have been scored a “Results” printout is created, placing teams in rank order from highest score to lowest, and also showing rankings within each competition category. (Vet, Open, Men, Mixed, etc).

If several Tags have the same Team number, their results are combined into one overall result, normally based on the slowest time and lowest score of all the Tags in that team. An option exists to take the slowest time and highest score of all the Tags in each team.

The Punches can be searched for a particular Tag number to show its time of punching. This has been provided to remove the need for an Intentions Log at each checkpoint.
